    <h3>Before you begin</h3>
    <p>
        Tryal.AI's technology aims to replicate real exams as closely as possible. Whilst most students
        don't take their GCSE maths on a computer, the principle here is the same so remember:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Show all your workings (we'll provide additional space)</li>
        <li>Use the marks shown as a guide to what is expected</li>
        <li>Make sure to read the question carefully</li>
        <li>All papers shown here should be assumed to be calculator papers and you will need a calculator</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When you write your workings you'll be shown a workings space, we will change this slightly depending
        on what is appropriate to the question. For example, if a question contains or requires drawing, we'll 
        give you a window that will allow you to sketch
    </p>
    <p>Here is what a typical working line looks like</p>
    <Line />
    <p>
        If need to write a statement rather than maths workings such as "Positive Correlation" for a line of best 
        fit question, click the blue button with the type in (e.g. "text" or "numerical") and it will change 
        the mode of that writing line.
